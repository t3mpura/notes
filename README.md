# README

Here is a collection of some notes/templates I have gathered over the past year or so in preparation for the OSCP. Feel free to use as reference. Keep in mind developing your own methodology is crucial as it is how you begin to truly understand what is going on. Also note that my notes may be VERY spotty in sections.

Access:
```
git clone https://github.com/t3mpura/notes.git
```

Unarchive the tar files:
```
tar -xf <file>.tar
```

I reccomend opening the files via Obsidian. If operating from Pwnbox, opening via GUI and LibreOffice is preferable to Vim for legibility.

Use the template file (or AD template if active directory is involved) as a checklist while going through a box. Use the master file for more in depth notes if not quite understanding something in the template file. notes.tar is an archive of a bunch of random stuff including footprinting, privesc, tools, etc... Use mainly for reference. bookmarks.md contains some URLs I regularly use during CTFs. Reference cheat sheets for quick one-liners ie: file_transfer, reverse_shells, etc...
